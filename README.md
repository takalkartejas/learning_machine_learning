## Theory
<details> <summary>
Tutorial1 - What is machine learning
   
</summary>

   1. Humans have neurons in there brains
   2. when you tell baby that this is cow then specific neurons light up and their edges become strong as shown in the image, for car different set of neuron lights up.

    3. Deep learning uses neural network similar to this
    4. Machine learning examples- scam email detection, alexa google assitant, google recomendations, driverless cars etc.

Tutorial4 - Gradient Descent and Cost function
   
</summary>

1. In linear regresssion we minimize the mean squared error as shown in the followin figure

2. Mean squared error - actual data point - the predicted data point then square then sum then divde by n
3. The mean square error is one of the cost functions, y pred  mx +b, the equation looks as follows

4. Gradient descent algorithm finds the best fit line for given training data set in minimum steps.
5. We start with certain values of m and b and find their cost which here is 1000. Now keep changing m and b till we reach the lower most point.
6. We are starting from the star and heading towards red dot

<details> <summary>
Tutorial3 - linear regression multiple variable
   
</summary>
1. The linear equation for price will be 
   price = m1*area + m2*bedrooms + m3*age + b
