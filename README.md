## Theory
<details> <summary>
Tutorial1 - What is machine learning
   
</summary>

   1. Humans have neurons in there brains
   2. when you tell baby that this is cow then specific neurons light up and their edges become strong as shown in the image, for car different set of neuron lights up.

    3. Deep learning uses neural network similar to this
    4. Machine learning examples- scam email detection, alexa google assitant, google recomendations, driverless cars etc.
